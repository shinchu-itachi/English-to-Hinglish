# English-to-Hinglish
# English to Hinglish Translation using Sequence-to-Sequence Model

This guide covers training a sequence-to-sequence model for translating English to Hinglish. We'll use Google Colab for this task. 

## Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Dataset

- Make sure your dataset is in JSON format, with two columns: "eng" for English and "hinglish" for Hinglish sentences.

### 2. Import Libraries

- Import the necessary Python libraries, including TensorFlow, pandas, and NLTK.

### 3. Load and Preprocess Data

- Load your JSON dataset.
- Tokenize English and Hinglish sentences.
- Pad sequences for uniform length.

### 4. Define the Model

- Set up the architecture of the sequence-to-sequence model.
- Include an attention mechanism for improved translation quality.

### 5. Prepare Training Data

- Prepare encoder input, decoder input, and decoder output sequences.
- Use one-hot encoding for the decoder output.

### 6. Compile and Train the Model

- Compile your model with appropriate loss and optimizer.
- Train the model using the prepared data.

### 7. Translation Function

- Implement a function for translating English sentences to Hinglish using the trained model.

### 8. Run the Translation

- Provide an English sentence to the translation function to get the Hinglish translation.

## Usage in Google Colab

1. Upload your dataset JSON file to Google Colab.
2. Open a new Colab notebook.
3. Paste the provided code into the notebook.
4. Update the data loading step with the file path of your dataset.
5. Run each cell of code in the notebook.
6. Use the translation function to translate English sentences to Hinglish.

## Dataset 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this English to Hinglish Translation Model is structured in JSON format. It contains a collection of English sentences paired with their corresponding Hinglish translations. Each data point in the dataset is represented as a JSON object with two key-value pairs: "eng" for English and "hinglish" for Hinglish. (Dataset is created by me not taken from any where)

Here is an example of the dataset structure:

{"eng": "Call me back.", "hinglish": "मुझे वापस call करो।"}


That's it! You have now trained a model for English to Hinglish translation.

Enjoy translating English to Hinglish!
